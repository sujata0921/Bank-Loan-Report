# Bank-Loan-Report
Iâ€™m thrilled to present my newly created Excel dashboard on Bank Loan Reports, showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) of the loan application process and insights into loan data analysis. 

This project features a variety of visualizations including:

Map Charts: Geographic distribution of loan applications.
Bar Charts: Approval and rejection rates.
Line Charts: Monthly loan application trends.
Donut Charts: Reasons for loan analysis (risk assessment, fraud detection, etc.).
Key KPIs include:

Total Loan Applications: Total received, Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
Total Funded Amount: Total disbursed, MTD amount, and MoM changes.
Total Amount Received: Total from borrowers, MTD amount, and MoM changes.
Average Interest Rate: Overall average, MTD rate, and MoM variations.
Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Overall average, MTD DTI, and MoM fluctuations.
A big thank you to DataTutorials for their invaluable guidance and support. Their comprehensive explanations and tutorials have been instrumental in helping me understand the essentials of bank loan report preparation.
